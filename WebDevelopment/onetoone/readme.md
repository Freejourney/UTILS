This is a web project based on maven

The architecture of this project is SSM, so if you are going to build a project with SSM, you can copy this project and modify some files to implement your own functions(you don't need to set configurations anymore)

The frontend of this project is Bootstrap.(I still don't familiar with this part of knowledge)
